## API Information

This node uses the Tally.so REST API endpoints:
- `GET /forms` - List all forms
- `GET /forms/{id}` - Get specific form details  
- `GET /forms/{id}/submissions` - Get form submissions

The node automatically handles:
- Authentication via Bearer token
- Different response formats from the API
- Error handling and user-friendly error messages
- Continue-on-fail functionality for workflow resilience

## Rate Limits

Tally.so implements rate limiting on their API. If you encounter rate limit errors:

- Reduce the frequency of your requests
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Contact Tally.so support if you need higher limits

## Error Handling

The node provides detailed error messages for common issues:

- **Invalid API token**: Check your credential configuration
- **Form not found**: Verify the form ID exists and you have access
- **Submission not found**: Check the submission ID is correct
- **Rate limit exceeded**: Implement delays between requests

## Troubleshooting

### Empty Submission Data

1. Verify the form has actual submissions
2. Check that you have the correct form ID
3. Ensure your API token has access to the form

### Connection Issues

1. Test your API credential in n8n
2. Verify your API token is valid in Tally.so
3. Check your network connectivity

### Form Not Loading

1. Ensure your API token has the correct permissions
2. Check that the form exists and hasn't been deleted
3. Verify you're using the correct form ID
