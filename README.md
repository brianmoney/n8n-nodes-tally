## Pagination

For large forms with many submissions, use the limit parameter and implement pagination:

1. Start with `Get All Submissions` with a reasonable limit (100-500)
2. Process the results
3. If you need more data, check the `hasNextPage` field in raw mode
4. Use the `endCursor` for subsequent requests

## Rate Limits

Tally.so implements rate limiting on their API. If you encounter rate limit errors:

- Reduce the frequency of your requests
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Contact Tally.so support if you need higher limits

## Error Handling

The node provides detailed error messages for common issues:

- **Invalid API token**: Check your credential configuration
- **Form not found**: Verify the form ID exists and you have access
- **Submission not found**: Check the submission ID is correct
- **Rate limit exceeded**: Implement delays between requests

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Receiving Data

1. Verify you're using the **production** webhook URL from n8n
2. Ensure your n8n webhook node accepts POST requests
3. Check that the webhook was created successfully in Tally.so
4. Test the webhook URL manually with a tool like Postman

### Empty Submission Data

1. Verify the form has actual submissions
2. Check that you have the correct form ID
3. Ensure your API token has access to the form

### Connection Issues

1. Test your API credential in n8n
2. Verify your API token is valid in Tally.so
3. Check your network connectivity

## Limitations

Current MVP limitations:

- No form creation/editing capabilities
- No analytics data retrieval
