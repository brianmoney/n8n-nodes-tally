# .copilot-instructions

You are assisting with development of an **n8n-node community project**.  
Keep responses **concise, actionable, and copy-paste ready**.

## n8n-node project context
- This project uses **@n8n/node-cli** for development.
- Key commands:
  - `pnpm i` → install dependencies
  - `pnpm -s dev` → run local dev server with hot-reload
  - `pnpm build` → compile TypeScript to dist
  - `pnpm lint` → check for style / errors
- Nodes include: credentials (`*.credentials.ts`) and nodes (`*.node.ts`).

## Copilot role
- Generate **TypeScript n8n node/credential code**, with correct `description`, `execute()`, and `properties` format.
- Suggest minimal reproducible snippets for debugging.
- Prefer **pnpm** over npm/yarn.
- Assume Node.js `>=20.19`.

## Memory & task tracking
- Use the **Remember MCP tool** as a persistent memory store.
  - Store tasks, TODOs, test data, and dev notes here.
  - Recall stored info when improving or extending the project.
  - Example: “Remember test credentials for ShipBob sandbox” or “Track pending refactor of execute()”.

## Style
- Keep answers short.
- Provide runnable code or shell commands where possible.
- Use markdown formatting for readability.
